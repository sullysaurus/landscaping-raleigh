              Artist and horticulturist <strong>Norman Rabins</strong> grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
              He studied horticulture at the Cape Technikon in Cape Town, SA and farming in Israel. He also 
              studied metal work under the tutelage of his late father, artist Monty Rabins, known in South 
              Africa for his copper masks and murals.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The splendor, diversity and dramatic range of color found in the Cape Fynbos region of his 
              native country and the vibrancy and imagination of African Folk have had great influence on 
              Norman's work.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6">
              Norman worked at the New York Botanical Garden in New York City for four years as Head Gardener 
              for the day lily, peony and iris collections before moving his family to North Carolina. They 
              currently reside in North Raleigh.
